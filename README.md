# WoW Tracker

WoW Tracker is a one page app built with the Angular CLI, and powered by Raider.io's public API.  Its purpose is to allow World of Warcraft players to easily view their various forms of gameplay progression all in one place as opposed to navigating to different websites and different pages within those sites.

## Mythic+ Tracker

The mythic+ section displays the current season's 0.1% cutoff, as well as all of a player's current progress (and whether their progress is above or below the cutoff).

## Raid Tracker

The raid section displays a player's guild's current raid progression for the active expansion, as well as their world ranking and region ranking.

## Friend Tracker

The friend tracker allows users to input their friend's names and server, and conveniently view their current mythic+ rating, along with their Class, Role, and Specialiation.

### Notes

- The website uses cookies to remember users' inputs when they return
- Friends can be added or removed via the corresponding + and x buttons
- Users can see whether their dungeons are above the current cutoff via the colour of the text (green is above, red is below, yellow is barely above)
